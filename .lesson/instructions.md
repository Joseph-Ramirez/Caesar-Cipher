## Objective
* You have been in the spy game for quite sometime 
and you are tired of always getting caught because 
the bad guys keep reading your messages. It is time 
to show those nosey people that you are not a spy 
they want to mess with. 
* You will embark on a coding journey where you will 
build code to mimic the famous Caesar Cipher. This 
way you will be able to encode (make unreadable) and 
decode (make readable) your messages. You will use the 
skills you have been taught throughout the past lessons. 
You will also learn new C++ code. The goal is to create 
code that will take in text and an integer. Then it 
will shift the letters of the text by the number that 
was entered. This should cause the text to encode or decode 
(depending on what the user enters). 
* Follow the comments throughout the program and reference 
the project powerpoint for code that does not look familiar. 
Donâ€™t forget to look back at previous power points for guidance.
